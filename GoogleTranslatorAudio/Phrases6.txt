SRS is: a plan for development and operation 
SRS synonyms are: customer requirements / statement of work / terms of reference 
SRS purpose is to: establish the basis / provide info about costs and schedules / refine baseline 
Useful phrases: it is agreed / established that as appropriate / as a minimum
It is agreed that the Contractor will provide maintenance services on regular basis.
We are meeting to refine the baseline and to complete the final version of the customer requirements.
320 mb of free space for the website must be provided as a minimum
Structure: introduction / overall description  / specific requirements / appendices 
Introduction: purpose / scope / definitions 
Overall description: product perspective / functions  / constraints / use cases  
Specific requirements: all the possible requirements = body of the document 
Useful phrases: identify / limit options, content, structure, product, external interfaces
Overview is a section that identifies the product and describes the content and the structure.
Anything that limits our options is described in the constraints.
All the possible requirements usually identify the body of the document. 
Correct: up to the required standards for the quality / database integrity 
Unambiguous and complete: describe what is the future project created for 
Consistent and detailed: how it interacts with people, hardware and other external interfaces 
Modifiable and traceable: the one you can edit and control 
Useful phrases: imposed on an implementation / main considerations / operation environment 
Please, make sure that your SRS is up to all the standards imposed on an implementation.
Don’t forget to describe the operation environment of the future project. 
The main consideration why people will use our program is for navigation. 
Ambiguity: don’t give too much or too little information that may not be verified 
Requirements on users: you can only assume what user will do 
Unnecessary or invented terms: avoid any extra terms if you can say it simple 
Useless phrases: never mention forward reference / contradiction / noise / silence
You can’t make a user do something, so try to assume what he or she will do with the application.
There can’t be noise or silence in your SRS - give enough information on each of the points.
Say it simple if you can and don’t invent new terms!
