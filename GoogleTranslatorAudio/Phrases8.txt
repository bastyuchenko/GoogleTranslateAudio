Priorities: things we need to do / things  we can do / things we want to do 
Why: we are starting a new project to help businesses get rid of viruses 
What: we are working on a striking firewall program 
Who: our best developers will be involved in the project 
When: we are going to present a working beta-version this summer
At first, we need to write a code for the browser.
We are about to start a new project to streamline the database operations.
The application we are working on is a new navigator for mobile devices. 
The team of designers is the first one to start their work. 
Our plan is to launch the project in March.
Tasks: set a kick-off meeting / develop a working beta / initiate a testing process 
Responsibles: is / are responsible for a working beta 
Start / end dates: 4th of July to 7th of August 
Task status: complete / in progress / overdue / not started
The first thing on our plan is to initiate a testing process of the cloud service.
QA department is responsible for the user logs.
The task is to be complete on the 4th of July.
Terms: strict / tight / agreed 
Setting terms: estimate project duration / model different scenarios / stick to realistic completion dates 
Worst case scenario: due to potential problems / possible difficulties / the timeframe is not sufficient
We have a really tight deadline.
Don’t you think we need to stick to realistic completion dates?
Due to the potential problems we can’t meet the deadline
Forecasting: we are hoping to / we are planning / we would rather / we intend to 
Oversighting: identify pain points /  allot responsibles in cold blood / share all news  on the project 
Being late:  shift the terms a little / delay for a day / veer off a course
We intend to get 5 000 users by winter.
The main pain point is low traffic capacity.
Is it possible to delay for a day? The testing is not complete.
01. There are three things we need to do today. 
02. We are working on a new app for IOS. 
03. Our best developers are involved in this project. 
04.  We are going to present the prototype next Monday. 
05.  Unfortunately, the status of this task is not started.
06. Newton is responsible for this task. He is writing the code at the moment. 
07. We set a kick off meeting yesterday. 
08. Can we initiate the testing process tomorrow? 
09. Our project manager estimated the developing process duration in two days. 
10. Before you start coding, don’t forget to stick to realistic completion dates!
11. We are hoping to attract 1 million users by the next year. 
12. Can we delay for a day? We have almost finished but there are small details left. 
13. We will rather finish the project by Friday and relax at the weekend. 
14. They have to veer off the course last week because of unexpected bugs. 
15. We started working on the website later due to the potential problems with the connection.
We are starting a new project to make the bank operations more secure and our to-do list is just huge.
Don’t waste your time. The website must be on at 3 p.m.
We will have to work overtime to ensure that the project is finished on time.
What is the due date of the developing process? 
The partners completed the route map of their future cooperation. 
It is difficult to work at this frantic pace.
We have got sufficient data to initiate the testing process. 
The manager set the kick off meeting for Thursday, so don’t be late!
