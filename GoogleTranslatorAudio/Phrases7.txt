04.  Please, let me summarize what we discussed today.

13. Therefour, we will communicate directly with our outsource department. 
14. I don’t think that’s a good idea. We should study the error reports deeply. 
15. What do you mean by the old version? We are still using it and there were no new updates!
The purpose of our meeting is to estimate the issues with the platform. 
I don’t think you are right. We need to totally change our methods of work.
He is likely to finish the stand-up meeting and recap what was said. 
Excuse me, what do you mean by the acceptable number of users? 
I’d say that the program is not completely tested on the mobile operating systems.
People were not able to log in to their accounts, especially with the help of Facebook.
We are currently working on the shared problems that are remaining from the last sprint.
You need to get everyone up to date on this quite a big traffic issue. 
Anyway, we have already completed most of the tasks and mainly thanks to our great team work.
Do you really think that we can move on if we still have the compatibility problems?
